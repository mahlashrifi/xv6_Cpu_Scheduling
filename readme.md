## About

This repository is for the third phase of the "Operating System" course project at Amirkabir University of Technology in Fall 2022.

The project has 3 phases:

#####  _⤷  [_phase1](https://github.com/mahlashrifi/xv6_New_SystemCall/blob/master/README)

#####  _⤷  [_phase2](https://github.com/mahlashrifi/xv6_Thread_Implementation)

#####  _⤷  [_phase3](https://github.com/mahlashrifi/xv6_Cpu_Scheduling)



## Overview

In this phase, various CPU scheduling algorithms are implemented and integrated into the xv6 operating system to study their impact on process management.



## New Scheduling Policies

- **Round Robin**: Ensures each process gets an equal share of the CPU.
- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**: Prioritizes processes based on a defined priority level.
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**: Organizes processes in multiple queues based on priority, with Round Robin scheduling within each queue.
- **Lottery Scheduling**: Assigns execution chance to processes based on a lottery system.

The functionality and performance of each scheduling algorithm can be tested using specific commands designed for this purpose.
